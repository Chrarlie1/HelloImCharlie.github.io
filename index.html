          My name is Charlie, and I’m glad you’re here. This space is a my website. As a Student in the University of the           cordilleras, I made it for my studies in Web Development and made this website as an output. On this site,                you’ll find a brief introduction about me as well as some of the links for my gallery and hobbies.<br>

          Thanks for stopping by, I’m glad you’ve taken the time to visit. Feel free to navigate through my projects,           explore my works, or just browse around and I hope you enjoy your visit!

        <h4>Hi there!</h4>
           <p>
             I’m Charlie, a student currently studying Web Development at the University of Cordilleras. I’m  inerested about technology on computers, and I’m excited to dive deep into making websites. Over the past year I have been studying basic coding as well as concepts relating to the IT space.<br>
    <br>
    Currently, I’m working on finishing my course in Web development, and I’m particularly interested in front end development although I hope to eventually become a full stack developer. I enjoy playing games, drawing, and things that apply creativity which helps me stay balanced and inspired.<br>
