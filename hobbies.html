  Hi there! This page is dedicated to what I am passionate about, such a few creative and tech-savvy pursuits. I love drawing—whether it’s sketching in my notebook or working on digital art, it’s a great way for me to express myself and explore my imagination. I’m also a big fan of Gundams; building and customizing these intricate models is both a relaxing and rewarding challenge.

  Gunpla, short for "Gundam plastic models," is a  hobby that I occasionally spend time on. It revolves around building and customizing models based on the mobile suits from the various Gundam anime series. You do it by assembling model kits of various  robots each with their own detailed designs and articulation.<br>
 <br>
  They kits come in different grades, ranging from beginner-friendly high-grade and entry-grade models to my personal favorite highly detailed and complex real grades.<br>
  <br>
  I personally enjoy them as It de-stressess me when I build them and the satisfaction I get when they look great finished. Just sit down, put some music on and relax for a couple of hours as your creation comes to life.

Drawing is the art of crating an image on a surface using various tools and techniques. At its core, drawing involves making marks, which are usuually lines or shapes, on a surface. The surfaces can be paper, canvas, or digital screens used to produce a visual representation.<br>
  <br>
  I personally like it because drawing gives me a form of creative expression. For me, it can serve as a powerful outlet for articulating my imaginations, thoughts and stories while also allowing me to show my creativity.<br>
  <br>
  I feel like drawing also offers me a sense of personal achievement and growth. As I practice and refine my skills, they experience a tangible sense of progress and completing a drawing provides a sense of accomplishment.

Video games are interactive digital entertainment experiences that engage players through a combination of graphics, sound, and gameplay mechanics. They exist across various platforms, including consoles, PCs, and mobile devices, and can range from simple puzzles to complex simulations.<br>
  <br>
  I like video games as tthey allow me to step into different worlds where I can explore, create, and interact in ways that are simply not possible in reality. Whether I am navigating a fantastical realm, solving intricate puzzles, or engaging in intense combat, the sense of immersion pulls me into the game’s narrative and environment.<br>
  <br>
   Essentialy, my enjoyment for video games is rooted in their ability to offer immersive experiences, foster personal growth, create social connections, and deliver compelling narratives.
